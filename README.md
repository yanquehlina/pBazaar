React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain. This also ensures a more dynamic and responsive user experience.

Vite
Vite is a build tool that provides a fast and optimized development environment. It offers instant server start, and enhances development speed and productivity by providing a modern development workflow with minimal configuration.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by enabling developers to apply styles directly in the markup, leading to more readable and maintainable code. Tailwind's approach reduces the need for writing custom CSS, speeding up the styling process.

Lucide
Lucide is an open-source icon library providing a comprehensive set of customizable SVG icons. It integrates well with modern front-end frameworks like React, making it easy to include scalable and customizable icons in the project.

Why These Libraries?
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing for reusable components and efficient state management, which is crucial for a dynamic web app like Flogix.
Vite: Selected for its fast development environment and efficient build processes, ensuring a smooth and productive development workflow.
Tailwind CSS: Utilized for its utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid development and maintenance of a consistent design system.
Lucide: Integrated for its extensive collection of customizable icons, enhancing the user interface with scalable and visually appealing icons.
These libraries collectively contribute to a robust, efficient, and maintainable codebase, ensuring the Flogix web app is performant, visually appealing, and easy to develop.
